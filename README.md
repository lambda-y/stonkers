This application is used to run as a bot to watch stocks and grab stock information 
to respond back to the Discord servers where the bot is added to. I wanted people to
collaborate and share market strategies among friends or commrads to create a well
diversified portfolio and invest!

The project needs a API token in order to communicate with Discord.
